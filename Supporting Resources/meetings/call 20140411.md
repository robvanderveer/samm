SAMM CALL April 11 2018

Attendees: Seba, Sam Stepanyan, Daniel, Yan, Trey Blalock, Jeff

Review/feedback SAMMv2
Summit workshops

Notes:

Suggestion to add SAMMv2 during the workshops prior to the summit
Use GitHub issues instead of spreadsheet input
devsecops included in the scope of SAMMv2
too much waterfall 
implementation guidance will cater to specific development types (waterfall, devops, agile, ...)

strategy - start from scratch and focus more on DevOps?
align language/documentation to cover automation
check if there are activities that involve manual actions...?

structure?
implies waterfall?
=empowerment of engineering teams / shifted left?
turn policy into code (development, runtime configuration + speed + continously implementation)
operations section in samm
Samm to cover more ops versus devs 

idea=focus on modern development processes, like devsecops

NIST SP800-53A - priorities in levels 1-2-...
