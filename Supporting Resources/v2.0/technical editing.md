Technical editing work:  

In the coming months we plan to release the beta and release candidate versions of SAMMv2.  
As team we have contributed and edited parts of the text, of which the latest version is available here: http://owaspsamm.org/ . 

We are looking to hire a technical editor to help us with these releases.  
Main tasks would be to get a consistent vocabulary, tone and structure throughout the text.  

We think of having some style guideline and proofreading support for the team to work on the Beta release (by Xmas).  
And then rewriting / technical editing for the Release Candidate and Final Version (April - June next year).  

Hard to tell how much the effort would be.  
Based on 150 words per activity and 90 activities, the total text would be about 13.000 to 15.000.  

Currently we are talking to a couple of candidates, hoping to start with a technical editor by 6 December.
