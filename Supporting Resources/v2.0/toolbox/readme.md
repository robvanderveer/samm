release of the updated Excel based toolbox to perform assessments for SAMMv2

The SAMM core model is used to measure and benchmark your software security assurance program and to demonstrate improvements.
So, with the goal to release SAMM v2.0 before the end of the year, the project team have continued to work on and develop the SAMM assessment format, scoring and quality indicators for all the business functions in the model: Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations.

The SAMM maturity questions have been updated, together with our toolbox spreadsheet. The SAMM2 assessment has been improved to measure the quality of you own software assurance maturity performance. The toolbox allows you to review your security activities against the defined quality criteria and calculate your maturity score.

The SAMM questionnaire has been restructured to reflect the new SAMM2 maturity streams.

Try it out and let us know how it works for you?
