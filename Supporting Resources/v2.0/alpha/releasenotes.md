After a year of work by the SAMMv2 team, we now release the alpha version of our new SAMMv2 framework.

Our objective is to update the SAMM framework taking into account the following improvements:
1) clean out inconsistencies from the previous release;
2) a more logical flow of maturity levels of the security activities as part of the SAMM practices;
3) take into account software development agile and DevOps practices;
4) decrease the number of "audit or quality gate" activities in the previous framework.

A core team - with the help of many volunteers - has worked on the new framework since the last OWASP summit in June 2017.
During that summit, we lay the foundations of version 2.0. 
We then added more details to the draft version with an extra summit in Reykjavik and extra online conference calls throughout 2017 and the last months.

The major changes are:
1) The addition of a new business function "Implementation", covering 3 security practices: Secure Build, Secure Deployment and Defect Management.
2) The introduction of 2 "Activity Steams" per security practice (this replaces the A and B activities which did not have a logical relation in the previous release). Each activity stream consists of 3 security activities (increasing in maturity level).

We now release the draft version for feedback, available here: https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ag3u_YTLhehYgaNki2Voe0t-6UaGbw
