## Call for feedback on new toolkit


As part of our work towards OWASP SAMM V2 we've updated our toolbox. This beta version contains the list of new questions and quality criteria that make up our measurement model. All feedback is welcome. Try it out and get back to us. We'd love to hear your thoughts!
