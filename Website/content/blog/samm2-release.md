#### After three years of preparation, our SAMM project team has delivered version 2 of SAMM!

OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) is the OWASP framework to help organizations assess, formulate, and implement, through our self-assessment model, a strategy for software security they can integrate into their existing Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The new SAMM v2 consists of the following components:

* The [SAMM Model](/model/) overview and introduction, explaining the maturity model in detail
* A [Quick-start Guide](/guidance/quick-start-guide/) with different steps to improve your secure software practice
* An updated [SAMM Toolbox](/assessment/) to perform SAMM assessments and create SAMM roadmaps
* A new [SAMM Benchmark initiative](/benchmarking/) to compare your maturity and progress with other similar organizations and teams

### What's changed with SAMM v2?

For those organizations using earlier versions of SAMM, it’s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved in favor of automation and better alignment with development teams. Organizationally, some important changes worth noting:

* Construction is now Design
* New business function: Implementation
* Redesigned business function: Verification
* New security practice: Operational Management
* Operational Enablement no longer exists and other practices absorbed its activities

Activities are now ordered in logical flows throughout each of the 15 security practices divided into two streams, which aligns and links the activities in the practice over the different maturity levels.

The new model supports maturity measurements both from coverage and quality perspectives. We added new quality criteria for all the activities. There is an updated scoring SAMM toolbox designed to help assessors and organizations with their software assurance assessments and roadmaps.

We have a single source using [GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/samm) and we can automatically generate PDF documents, the website, the toolbox, and applications. All the model content has been converted to YAML files, allowing tools or other SAMM consumers to automatically use the model. You can always find the latest version of SAMM on our website, in the [Model section](/model/). The full release notes for version 2 are available [here](/release-notes-v2/).

As always, feedback is welcome in our usual channels:

* the [SAMM Github repository](https://github.com/OWASP/samm/issues)
* our [#project-samm](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH) Slack channel  
* our email address [info@owaspsamm.org](mailto:info@owaspsamm.org)

Seba Deleersnyder and Bart De Win, SAMM Project co-leaders, commented: “This is a really important release for the project team. We are grateful for the team, our SAMM community, and the help of our sponsors, With all of them, after three years, we now have an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture”.

Don’t forget to look around our [new website](https://owaspsamm.org/), review the [updated model](/model/) and [toolbox](/assessment/).
